# Semaphore Smart Contract Wallet

A sample for testing ZK with EIP 4337 account abstraction. 

Everyone in a Semaphore group collectively owns a wallet and send transactions with ZK proof of memberships.

This is not meant for actual use - this don't work with 4337 directly as the wallet need to access semaphore contract for proof verification.
